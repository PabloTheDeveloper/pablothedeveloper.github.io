I remember a few weeks ago the shelter had kittens who had not been well socialized with people yet. After doing the day to day, I sat on the floor in their enclosure to see what I could do. They cautiously observed this strange human sitting there with them. From the safety of their cubby-like furniture. A part of being a volunteer is that we need to interact with our cats. Cats, although mostly solitary, need some human interaction and general stimulation. In that, they aren't so different from people. Although people tend to need more. I didn't expect to make much progress but that isn't a reason to not try so that led me to sit there with them. I also waved a toy attached to some string in the air above them and on the floor. Not continously but occasionally. In this, my aim was to transform the toy into some animated creature that cats would pounce and chase after. A few minutes later, one of the kittens came out and started inspecting me. I didn't try to move. I let them smell and look at me. They came out and started playing with the toy. It was wonderful. I couldn't stay for too long but with that, my aim was accomplished. This little kitten was one step closer to being adopted and having a generally better life. By now that kitten and its brothers/sisters will have found a home. Perhaps it could have been my home but I believe my place in life right now is one that cares for animals rather than owns them.

At some point, routine tasks become automatic and don't seem to exhaust anymore cognitive resources than mostly mindless tasks like walking and speaking. Yet, those tasks still occupy some portion of our minds. Furthermore they can request additional resources if the complexity deviates more than what was typically encountered. Of course, after some time of a new environment we acclimate to that complexity. A hiker thinks less of the rugged terrain they step on than a city dweller. But, if that hiker were to stop hiking for a few weeks or months their effort to walk amoungst that terrain would increase. Applying those ideas in a cognitively demanding landscape one could see how there is some merit to entirely eliminating or reducing mundanity. To acquire an aptitude in a routine task temporarily, only to forget, or to not apply in a generalizable manner those resulting abilities, does seem a waste or inefficient. With any practical programming ability one is able to skirt some of the slowdown but is not sensible to do so for all routine tasks. So then what tasks then are sensible? I feel that for myself the answer is that which I want to prioritize in life. Outside of family, friends, health, and career, the needs I have after are what I should focus on. That's the big picture. In practice, surprisingly there are few widely applicable insights I've encountered in my own journey of reducing friction. Guidelines on what to improve, what to really improve and where to stop. Lesson #1: Fail Early It is critical, that if one is trying anything, that there is some evaluation criteria on whether it is worth doing now, worth it later in the future, and then beyond. There are some tasks for which the payoff is at the end of much investment. Others bring yields earlier. Some tasks bring marginal yields at the start and then decline in value later (think about clean up tasks after trying out some organizational system). Everything has a cost and a benefit whose value fluctuates on different dimensions in non-linear, staggered ways. While it's not easy to predict, it is much easier to evaluate the past and see where to look next. Lesson #2: Usage is Validation If you find yourself regularly using your shortcut or improved process that's a great hint that something is working. Be mindful that there could be confounding external variables which influence it but most likely something about the new thing is working. Even if it's not globally optimal, the existance of a process actively followed is better than one intermidiately. Like a scientist, examine the causes and see which affordances are genuinely leading to more intentional behavior. Lesson #3: Short Feedback Loops > Long Feedback Loops It is easy to get emotionally invested in large projects and for those feelings to superceed practical concerns such as if it is worth continuing or if others are finding value in it. To be pigeonholed should be avoided but also be mindful that sometimes such projects are the ones that payout the most. A middle ground to reach is to create successively large subprojects that expand in function to the larger aim. This is where the concept of a MVP comes in. However, instead of one that is most fitting of the demands of a situation, it is barely that. The minimal part of mvp must be emphasized. It must be understood as barely functioning. It must be simple too, but no simpler than needed. Sometimes this means constraining the features and interaction but this is for the better. As primary users of our own systems, especially ones to cut down on routine/mundane tasks, we must use them. Otherwise is it a project thrown in the wrong direction. If a project is to be cancelled then the reasons why are equally as important as the reasons to continue if it were successful. Concluding thoughts I wouldn't list out all the ways I do this and all the tools and systems I've tried but there are a fair number. Some have sticked and others less so. While earlier in my journey I saw these speedup processes as a magical means to greater ability, and they certainly help, this is not the case. The habits of mind and the values one cultivates are far more helpful. Though, that doesn't mean that no effort should be dedicate to cut down on inefficiency. Secondly, new tools and systems which prior systems depend upon are always coming out. There is a lifespan to most optimizations one can try out. For me, I'm trying to dedicate my time to those that I can see myself using for a long time. I still dedicate time to those that may be short lived but I am aware of their lifespan. It is difficult to say what tasks are worth improving but for me, I find it fun to try. In that, it isn't as bad a loss if an approach doesn't work out. It teaches me what doesn't work and I get to learn some new way of thinking. Perhaps, framing optimizations in that way, can be helpful for other trying to optimize their lives too.","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"writings/reflections/#1-better","text":"Field Label Date 2025-05-01 Time 10:00 PM Spark Reflecting on speedups There is an extra benefit to making mundane tasks easier other than time saved.

In short, he was destined through sheer force of will, peternatural ability, dedicated study, top class familial support, along with encouraging peers, to make transformative changes in the world. Having finish the book, my secondary conclusion is that not a single idea or product defined Microsoft. Yes, at the start, supporting the programming language Basic was key to their survival. But if it were anyone else of lesser ability, I don't think they too could have made Microsoft. Furthermore, while chance has had massive role in the success of Microsoft, entirely dismissing the difficult work Bill and the early Microsoft team undertook is too easy to make. Bill, in his efforts, did not come away from Microsoft without incurring some personal cost. While he had time to learn and socialize, eventually the company took up most of his free time and headspace. Perhaps those gripped in the throes of passion care less about that loss. Perhaps they see it as a gain and learn to continue seeing it in that way. Most of us are on some spectrum on that passion scale. I imagine most of us have momentarily felt the way Bill did, where from waking to sleeping, all he did was for what consumed him at the time. Maybe we wouldn't be as effective but that feeling isn't so alien. It normally doesn't posses us the way it did him and it did for many successful people. Some could take away from the book that his opportunities are what made him entirely successful. That is true in the universal way that it is true for all our endevours, but to readers seeking lessons, it is not a helpful thought. Most, will not have the same background Bill had but that's no reason to not start now or even try. We are more advantaged than Bill was in some ways. We do not have to memorize the Dewey Decimal System to find books on topics we want to learn about. Nowadays we can use some search engine. We don't have spend 5hrs on each iteration loop, nor do we need to print out our code. We don't need to read extensive manuals to get bare functionality up. In this world of abstractions, we are by output more effective than a Bill stuck in the 1970s. In raw brain power and skill I don't think most can match up to Bill. Only if from childhood were a social and intellectual growth fostered would ordinary people stand a chance. However, to throw our hands in the air, and to not try, well that's no way to live. Growth doesn't stop at adulthood. It is always progressing and regressing for our skills and thought habits. I come away from reading the book, being more grateful to the background my parents and community supported for me. I didn't have parties being thrown to socially engineer my ability to discuss complex topics with leaders of commerce. Instead, I did have a safe home to sleep in and some friends to hang out and enjoy life with. Bill had those too but I, and I imagine many others, aren't so deprived. I didn't go to a selective private school. I went to a mostly public school where my curiousity was allowed to be explored as much as I wanted it to be. It could have been more rigorous and intense but it was at a sufficient level to allow me a basic skill in writing, reading, and speaking. In these later years, I feel a more voracious appetite to understand more of the world and make some transformative impact. Not at the scale of Microsoft, but something somewhere worth being in the world.","title":"Reviews"},{"location":"writings/reviews/#source-code-by-bill-gates","text":"Field Label Date 2025-05-17 Time 10:00 AM Bill Gates details the origins of who he is by extensively covering his childhood, adolescent life, and early adulthood before Microsoft became the giant it is now.

In this world of abstractions, we are by output more effective than a Bill stuck in the 1970s. In raw brain power and skill I don't think most can match up to Bill. Only if from childhood were a social and intellectual growth fostered would ordinary people stand a chance. However, to throw our hands in the air, and to not try, well that's no way to live. Growth doesn't stop at adulthood. It is always progressing and regressing for our skills and thought habits. I come away from reading the book, being more grateful to the background my parents and community supported for me. I didn't have parties being thrown to socially engineer my ability to discuss complex topics with leaders of commerce. Instead, I did have a safe home to sleep in and some friends to hang out and enjoy life with. Bill had those too but I, and I imagine many others, aren't so deprived. I didn't go to a selective private school. I went to a mostly public school where my curiousity was allowed to be explored as much as I wanted it to be. It could have been more rigorous and intense but it was at a sufficient level to allow me a basic skill in writing, reading, and speaking. In these later years, I feel a more voracious appetite to understand more of the world and make some transformative impact. Not at the scale of Microsoft, but something somewhere worth being in the world.","title":"Source Code by Bill Gates"}]}
