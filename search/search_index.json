Practically speaking, what one doesn't write one tends to forget. Writing further crystalizes understanding and serves as a cognitive tool to advance thinking. Really, these works save me time. Lastly, this world has unbrimming amounts of knowledge and fascinations. It would be tragic to not capture some portion.

I have many projects of the past, present, and future that will be documented in this section. Additionally, there will be a Changelog section where I log frequent developer notes.

That had a single README.md file with aspirations in one page. This realizes it further. I suppose one barrier to advancing that was scheduling a regular time to do this work. To make this personal site required some activation amount of work. Now that I've reach a mostly editable and deployable state, I can proceed. Originally, my intentions were to use golang but I will pass on that for expediency reasons. Eventually, I'll have to update this to use docker instead of python's venv. I abhor installing local packages onto my development machine. This extends to python's venv library I had to install. No practical consequences will come from that but it makes development changes less reproducible.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"hobbies/","text":"Introduction What life is there without leasure?
