Practically speaking, what one doesn't write one tends to forget. Writing further crystalizes understanding and serves as a cognitive tool to advance thinking. Really, these works save me time. Lastly, this world has unbrimming amounts of knowledge and fascinations. It would be tragic to not capture some portion. By trade I am no writer but everyone has something to say and a life worth writing about. Where to Next? For fellow coders and software engineers head to the Coding section. For all others, browse per your interests. The Writing section could be interesting.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"\u201cIt's never too late to be what you might have been.\u201d Welcome to my site :) Contained within is a collection of my works.

No, it is not due to rm -rf being misplaced. It is due to how mkdocs gh-deploy will overwrite whatever directory it is in. This wasn't too bad as it took a few minutes to copy the file contents from the site back into markdown. It does make me want to update the mkdocs command to not overwrite without letting the user known what is going to overwritten. I doubt many people have workflows in which they are intending to do that. It would help on the usability front. 50% Done w/ Personal Site Date: 2025-04-11 Project: personal-site Update: improved site I have figured out how improve my prior personal site. That had a single README.md file with aspirations in one page. This realizes it further. I suppose one barrier to advancing that was scheduling a regular time to do this work. To make this personal site required some activation amount of work. Now that I've reach a mostly editable and deployable state, I can proceed. Originally, my intentions were to use golang but I will pass on that for expediency reasons. Eventually, I'll have to update this to use docker instead of python's venv. I abhor installing local packages onto my development machine. This extends to python's venv library I had to install. No practical consequences will come from that but it makes development changes less reproducible.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"coding/changelog/#kerfuffle-in-last-deployment","text":"Date: 2025-04-22 Project: personal-site Update: deleted & re-created site I had unintentionally deleted my project site files haha.

In 2024 and 2025 it'll probably focus on cats.","title":"Index"},{"location":"volunteering/cats/","text":"Cats 101 Date:2025-04-22 Cats can be shy creatures. I remember a few weeks ago the shelter had kittens who had not been well socialized with people yet. After doing the day to day, I sat on the floor in their enclosure to see what I could do. They cautiously observed this strange human sitting there with them. From the safety of their cubby-like furniture. A part of being a volunteer is that we need to interact with our cats. Cats, although mostly solitary, need some human interaction and general stimulation. In that, they aren't so different from people. Although people tend to need more. I didn't expect to make much progress but that isn't a reason to not try so that led me to sit there with them. I also waved a toy attached to some string in the air above them and on the floor. Not continously but occasionally. In this, my aim was to transform the toy into some animated creature that cats would pounce and chase after. A few minutes later, one of the kittens came out and started inspecting me. I didn't try to move. I let them smell and look at me. They came out and started playing with the toy. It was wonderful. I couldn't stay for too long but with that, my aim was accomplished. This little kitten was one step closer to being adopted and having a generally better life. By now that kitten and its brothers/sisters will have found a home. Perhaps it could have been my home but I believe my place in life right now is one that cares for animals rather than owns them. While I know at some point I'll foster/adopt a cat, maybe one I take care of at the shelter, for now this is enough.","title":"Cats"},{"location":"volunteering/cats/#cats-101","text":"Date:2025-04-22 Cats can be shy creatures.
